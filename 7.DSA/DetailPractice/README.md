## Data Structure and Algorithm in JavaScript

### Data Structure is a way to storing and orgnizing data in memory.

- Linear Data structure
- Non-Linear Data structure

### Linear Data Structure

A linear data structure is a type of data organization where elements are arranged sequentially, with each element connected to its previous and next element.
example: Array, Stack, Queue and Linked-list,

### Non-linear Data Structure

Non-linear data structure is a type of data structure where data elements are not arranged sequentially.
example: Heap, Tree, Graph

### Algorithm

An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions to solve a given problem

IPO: Take Input, process data and Output
