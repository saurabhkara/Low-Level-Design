//SOLID Principal

### The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that help developers write more maintainable, flexible, and scalable code.

## S - Single Responsibility Principle(SRP)

- ### A class should have a single responsibility

## O - Open-Close Principle (OCP)

- ### Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification

## L - Liskov Substitution Principle(LSP)

- ### If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T in a program may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of that program.

## I - Interface Segregation Priciple(ISP)

- ### Clients should not be forced to depend on methods that they do not use.

## D - Dependency Inversion Priciple(DIP)

- ### High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on the abstraction.Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
