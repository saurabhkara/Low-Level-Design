# Creational Design Pattern

## A creational design pattern is a type of design pattern that focuses on object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

1. Singleton design pattern
2. Factory design pattern
3. Prototype design pattern
4. Builder design pattern
5. Abstract design pattern

### 1. Singleton Design Pattern : The Singleton design pattern is a structural design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. Itâ€™s useful when you want to control access to shared resources, like a configuration object, logging service, or database connection.

### 2. Factory Design Pattern : The Factory Design Pattern is a creational pattern used to abstract the process of object creation. It allows you to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
