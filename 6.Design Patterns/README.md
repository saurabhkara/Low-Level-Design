### System design in software development refers to the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces and data for a system to satisfy specified requirement. It involves making high-level decisions that shape how a software is built, structured, and mainatined.

Types of System design

- High Level Design
- Low Level Design

### High Level Design - Architectural Design

- Focus on System Architecture
- Identifies main module/components and their relationship
- Deals with techonlogies, protocols, and infrastructure

### Low Level Design - Detailed Design

- Describes the internal logic of each module/component
- Includes class diagram, database schema, API contract
- Helps developers understand exactly how to implement the system

### Key elememts in system design

- Scalablity
- Reliability
- Availability
- Maintaintablity
- Performance
- Security

### System Design Process

- 1. Requirement analysis : Understand functional and non-functional requirement
- 2. Define system interface : APIs, communication between modules, external interaction
- 3. Architecture selection: Monith, Microservices, serverless, event-driven etc
- 4. Database Design : Relational, No-SQL, data-modeling, indexing strategies
- 5. Component design : Breakdown system into smaller, manageable parts
- 6. Scalability and performance planning : Caching, Load balancing, Data partitionalig etc.
- 7. Security consideration : Authentication, authorization, encryption etc.

### Design Pattern

A design pattern is a proven, reusable solution to a common problem in software design. Think of it as a blueprint — not code itself, but a general guide on how to structure code to solve specific types of problems.
Promote code reuse and consistency.
Make code easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

All the design patterns are categorised into three categories

- Creational Design Pattern
- Behavioral Design Pattern
- Structural Design pattern

### Creational Design Pattern

Creational design patterns deal with object creation mechanisms — trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation

- Factory Method: Creates objects without specifying the exact class
