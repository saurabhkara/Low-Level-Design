# BEHAVIOURAL DESIGN PATTERN

# Behavioral design patterns are focused on improving communication between objects. These patterns help with the interaction between objects, making the communication flexible and the responsibility of objects clear.

1. Observer design pattern
2. Strategy design pattern
3. State design pattern
4. Command design pattern
5. Chain of responsiblity design pattern
6. Template method design pattern
7. Visitor design pattern
8. Iterator design pattern
9. Mediator design pattern
10. Memento design pattern

### 1. Observer Design Pattern : Defines a dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependent objects are notified and updated automatically.

### 2. Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. The client can choose the appropriate algorithm at runtime.
