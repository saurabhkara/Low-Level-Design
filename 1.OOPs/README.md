# OOPs Concept

### OOPs - Object Oriented Programming is programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects.

### Benefits of OOPs

- Code reuseability
- Code security
- Modularity
- Debugging is easy

### Classes - Classes are the blue print of objects.

### Objects - Objects are real entity of classes.

### Principles of OOPs

- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism

### Encapsulation - Encapsulation is the concept of hiding the implementation and state of object and only exposing the necessary information of outside of object using access modifires(public,private). Benefit - Security

### Inheritance - Inheritance is mechanism where a child class can inherit or access the properties and methods of its parents class. Benefit - Code reuseability

### Abstraction - Abstraction is concept of hiding unneccesary information from outer wolrd while only showing neccessary information.

### Polymorphism - Polymorphism is an ability of an object to take on multiple forms.
