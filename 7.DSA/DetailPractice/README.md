## Data Structure and Algorithm in JavaScript

### Data Structure is a way to storing and orgnizing data in memory.

- Linear Data structure
- Non-Linear Data structure

### Linear Data Structure

A linear data structure is a type of data organization where elements are arranged sequentially, with each element connected to its previous and next element.
example: Array, Stack, Queue and Linked-list,

### Non-linear Data Structure

Non-linear data structure is a type of data structure where data elements are not arranged sequentially.
example: Heap, Tree, Graph

### Algorithm

An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions to solve a given problem

IPO: Take Input, process data and Output
Flowchart
Pseudo code

How data stored in memory: 1. Stack and 2. Heap memory

- Primitive data stores in Stack
- Non-primitive data stored in Heap memory

### Time and Space Complexity

Time complexity measures how the execution time of an algorithm increases as the input size grows.
while space complexity measures how the memory usage of an algorithm increases with the input size.

Notation to measure time and space complexity

- Big Oh(O)
- Theta (θ)
- Omega( Ω)
